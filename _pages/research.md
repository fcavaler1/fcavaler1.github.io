I study a preferred-habitat model of the term structure in which the same marginal investor prices government and corporate bonds. The model endogenously generates variation in credit spreads over and above changes in credit quality. In equilibrium, credit spreads are affine functions of the aggregate risk factors, providing an equilibrium justification to credit risk valuation models. Risk premia on interest rate and credit risk are time-varying and jointly determined. Arbitrage activity strengthens the risk-neutral dependence between the aggregate risk factors beyond the observed correlation between default rates and the policy rate. Movements in credit spreads are driven by (i) variation in credit quality (ii) risk-neutral correlation of the risk factors, and (iii) portfolio rebalancing due to diversification motives. A calibrated model matches the level and the slope of the term structure of credit spreads for both investment-grade and high-yield issuers. As government bonds hedge against default risk, the strength of monetary policy transmission to corporate (Treasury) yields is weaker (stronger) when default uncertainty increases. Shocks to the short term rate move credit spreads by altering risk premia on both credit and interest rate risk. The impact of quantitative easing interventions is asymmetric and depends on the specific assets being purchased.

1. [The Convenience Yield and the Demand for U.S. Treasury Securities]

This paper investigates the heterogeneity in investors’ preferences for non-pecuniary attributes of U.S. Treasury securities. My goal is to determine which groups of investors draw benefits from holding Treasuries and the reasons why they are willing to pay a premium over safe and liquid corporate bonds. I first present a conceptual framework to interpret the implications of heterogeneity in valuations of convenience on yields and price elasticities. Then, using sector-level bond holdings from the Financial Accounts, I recover structural demand curves and rank investors by their valuations of convenience services. Estimates reveal that the convenience of long term Treasuries is valuable for U.S. private depository institutions, and security brokers and dealers, whereas it is less attractive to households, pension funds and insurance companies. The ordering suggests that a safety attribute is secondary to liquidity even at longer maturities. Models of convenience yields should (i) accommodate heterogeneity in the elasticity of substitution between Treasuries and corporate bonds and (ii) incorporate liquidity motives at both long and short maturities.

   The speed of stock price reaction to news exhibits substantial time variation. Higher risk-bearing capacity of financial intermediaries, lower passive ownership of stocks, and more informative news increase price responses to contemporaneous news; surprisingly, these interaction variables also increase price responses to lagged news (underreaction). A simple model with limited attention and three investor types – institutional, non-institutional, passive – predicts the observed variation in news responses. A long-short trading strategy based on news sentiment earns high returns, which increase when conditioning on the interaction variables. The interactions we document are robust to the choice of news source.

1. [Retail Trading and Asset Prices: The Role of Changing Social Dynamics](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4236966)

   Social-media-fueled retail trading poses new risk to institutional investors. This paper examines the origin and pricing of this new risk. I first present stylized facts on prices, quantities, and retail investors’ beliefs for a set of meme stocks. I establish that aggregate fluctuations in retail sentiment originated from a growing and concentrated social network. The retail sentiment fluctuations induced changes in investor composition. As sentiment increased throughout 2020 and 2021, retail investors built up long positions, while price-sensitive long-only institutions have gradually exited the market since early 2020. Short interest stayed high in 2020, then dropped sharply following the price surge in January 2021, and remained low throughout 2021. Motivated by these facts, I develop a model of the interaction between three groups of investors – retail investors, long-only institutions, and short sellers. I calibrate the model to match the price, quantity, and retail sentiment dynamics during this period. Then I use the calibrated model to demonstrate that social network dynamics shape the distribution of retail sentiment and have an economically large impact on asset prices. In the model, retail investors participate in a social network with concentrated linkages. This implies that their idiosyncratic sentiment shocks can lead to aggregate fluctuations in retail sentiment. Aggregate retail sentiment shocks shift investor composition, which in turn determines the price of retail sentiment risk. Following an increase in the aggregate retail sentiment, price-elastic long-only institutions first hit their short-sale constraints, leading to a decrease in the aggregate demand elasticity in the market for an individual stock. Then a “small” positive retail sentiment shock can have a “large” price impact and even squeeze short sellers.

2. [Neoclassical Growth Transition Dynamics with One-Sided Commitment](../files/Krueger_Li_Uhlig_paper.pdf) (with Dirk Krueger and Harald Uhlig)

   This paper characterizes the transition dynamics of a continuous-time neoclassical production economy with capital accumulation in which households face idiosyncratic income risk. Insurance companies operating in perfectly competitive markets offer long-term insurance contracts and can commit to future contractual obligations, whereas households cannot. Therefore the equilibrium features imperfect insurance and a non-degenerate cross-sectional consumption distribution. When household labor productivity takes two values, one of which is zero, and the utility function is logarithmic, we show that the transition dynamics induced by unexpected positive or negative technology shocks, including the evolution of the consumption distribution, can be calculated in closed form, as long as the initial deviation from the steady state is not too large. This is in contrast to both the standard representative agent neoclassical growth model as well as Bewley (1986) style models with uninsurable idiosyncratic income risk.  Thus the paper provides an analytically tractable alternative to the standard incomplete markets general equilibrium model developed in Aiyagari (1994) by retaining its physical structure, but substituting the assumed incomplete asset markets structure with one in which limits to consumption insurance emerge endogenously, as in the macroeconomic literature on limited commitment.
