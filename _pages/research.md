I study a preferred-habitat model of the term structure in which the same marginal investor prices government and corporate bonds. The model endogenously generates variation in credit spreads over and above changes in credit quality. In equilibrium, credit spreads are affine functions of the aggregate risk factors, providing an equilibrium justification to credit risk valuation models. Risk premia on interest rate and credit risk are time-varying and jointly determined. Arbitrage activity strengthens the risk-neutral dependence between the aggregate risk factors beyond the observed correlation between default rates and the policy rate. Movements in credit spreads are driven by (i) variation in credit quality (ii) risk-neutral correlation of the risk factors, and (iii) portfolio rebalancing due to diversification motives. A calibrated model matches the level and the slope of the term structure of credit spreads for both investment-grade and high-yield issuers. As government bonds hedge against default risk, the strength of monetary policy transmission to corporate (Treasury) yields is weaker (stronger) when default uncertainty increases. Shocks to the short term rate move credit spreads by altering risk premia on both credit and interest rate risk. The impact of quantitative easing interventions is asymmetric and depends on the specific assets being purchased.

2. The Convenience Yield and the Demand for U.S. Treasury Securities

This paper investigates the heterogeneity in investorsâ€™ preferences for non-pecuniary attributes of U.S. Treasury securities. My goal is to determine which groups of investors draw benefits from holding Treasuries and the reasons why they are willing to pay a premium over safe and liquid corporate bonds. I first present a conceptual framework to interpret the implications of heterogeneity in valuations of convenience on yields and price elasticities. Then, using sector-level bond holdings from the Financial Accounts, I recover structural demand curves and rank investors by their valuations of convenience services. Estimates reveal that the convenience of long term Treasuries is valuable for U.S. private depository institutions, and security brokers and dealers, whereas it is less attractive to households, pension funds and insurance companies. The ordering suggests that a safety attribute is secondary to liquidity even at longer maturities. Models of convenience yields should (i) accommodate heterogeneity in the elasticity of substitution between Treasuries and corporate bonds and (ii) incorporate liquidity motives at both long and short maturities.
